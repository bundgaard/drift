Welcome to Drift!

Drift is an always-already versioned, cloud-backed text editor. You can use it to take notes, and save them in the GitHub cloud.

Your gists are always saved locally, and any changes you make will get pushed to GitHub's servers.

You can use the share button at the top-right to copy a link to one of your gists, or view it on the web in Safari.

You can navigate between your gists, or sign in as someone else, with the Gists button at the top left.

To name a gist, touch its name in the toolbar.

Try it out!
