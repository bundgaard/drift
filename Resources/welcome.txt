Welcome to Drift!

Drift is an always-already versioned, cloud-backed text editor. You can use it to take notes, and save them in the GitHub cloud.

Your gists are always saved locally. To push a gist to github, use the "Push" button at the top-right.

After you've pushed a gist, use the share button above to copy a link to it, or view the gist on the web in Safari.

You can navigate between your gists, or sign in as someone else, with the button to the top left showing your github username.

To name a gist, touch its name in the toolbar.

Try it out!
